# PyTorch Tutorials

A practical, progressively-structured set of PyTorch tutorials and experiments covering fundamentals, training workflows, and reusable patterns for deep learning projects.

## What this repo contains
This repository is organized as a set of small, focused modules. Depending on the folder, you will typically find:
- Minimal PyTorch examples (tensors, autograd, modules)
- Training loops (classification/regression) with clean abstractions
- Dataset + DataLoader patterns
- Model checkpoints and evaluation utilities
- Notes or notebooks for quick iteration

## Getting started

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch (CPU or CUDA build depending on your machine)
